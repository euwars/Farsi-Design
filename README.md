## Development Guideline

* __Easy to use__: the UX for the end-user, always keep it in mind, make it a pleasant experience to work with this app
* __Code should be kept simple__: easy to understand, easy to collaborate/contribute (as much as possible of course).
* __Compatibility__: never do an incompatible change, unless you can't avoid it. Release new features as additional options, to not to break existing configurations.
* __Language__: right now it's decided to do the project in Objective-c because of slow swift dylibs proccesing

## Builds automation 

*in progress (using [bitrise](http://bitrise.io/) and [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools)), when builds are ready testflight will be automated too.
